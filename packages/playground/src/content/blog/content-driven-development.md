Defining collection schemas by hand is tedious. You already have the data in your frontmatter — the CMS should figure out the types from what's there.

### How inference works

The scanner reads all `.md` and `.mdx` files in a collection directory. For each frontmatter field, it examines values across all entries to determine the type:

- Strings that look like URLs → `url` field type

- Strings that look like dates → `date` field type

- Arrays of objects → `array` with inferred object schema

- Boolean values → `boolean` toggle

- Numbers → `number` input

Fields that appear in some entries but not others are marked as optional. Fields that contain `null` are marked as nullable.

### The manifest

Inferred schemas are written to `cms-manifest.json` at build time. The editor reads this manifest to render the correct input types in the editing panel.

### Overriding inference

If the scanner gets a type wrong, you can always define the schema explicitly in `config.ts` using Astro's `defineCollection` API. Explicit schemas take priority over inferred ones.

### Status

This feature is still in development. The current implementation handles common patterns well but may misidentify edge cases like strings that happen to contain only digits.
